	*           This is a templated library for special matrix calculation.<br/>
	*           This namespace contains abstract classies for computations, and
	*           traits. Non of the classes call diractly the matrix, or numbers
	*           functions, it's used the matrix_traits, or number_traits,
	*           or vector_traits classes.
	*           <p/>
	*           If you want to use this library with your own classes and types, 
	*           you just do these base traits specialization, and it'll be work fine.
	* @version 1.1
