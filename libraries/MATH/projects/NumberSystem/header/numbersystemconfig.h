	*           This is a templated library for general number system, most of
	*           number system wich is defined in vector space.
	*           This class contains abstract classes for computation, and 
	*           different implementations.
	*           <p/>
	*           This library uses the MATH::LinearAlgebra and MATH::Algebra 
	*           libraries in the algorithm. If you want use this library maybe
	*           you must do some template specialization, in Linear Algebra,
	*           or in Algebra namespace.
	* @see LinearAlgebra
	* @see Algebra
	* @version 1.1
